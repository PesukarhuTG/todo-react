â€“ Adding Tasks: Users can enter a new task and save it by clicking the "Save" button or pressing the Enter key.
â€“ Completing Tasks: Completed tasks are marked as such and displayed with a strikethrough style.
â€“ Deleting Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list at any time.
â€“ Persistence: All tasks are saved in the Local Storage, allowing users to close and reopen the app without losing their data.
